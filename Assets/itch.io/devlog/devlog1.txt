Hello Gamers,

I am mek and I am thrilled to present my first game, "Destroyer"! This game is an action/shooter where your objective is to eliminate all enemies. The idea started from my desire to create something, and I learned a lot throughout the development process.

The game currently features two power-ups: the first adds extra bullets, and the second increases bullet speed. It was particularly enjoyable to work on adding new bullets, adjusting their angles, and implementing the random chance for characters to drop power-ups.

Thank you for playing my game! Your feedback is very valuable to me, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, feel free to let me know.

I have learned so much while developing this game and I am looking forward to creating more games in the future. I plan to add new features and fix any bugs soon, so stay tuned!

Have fun!
